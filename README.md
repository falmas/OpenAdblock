# Open Adblock 

OpenAdblock is a simple app that uses the new feature in iOS 9 called content blocking in Safari. We want to build the best adblock. In order to do so, it must be free and open source. Any help would be appreciated.

Open Adblock has moved to a new location, you can now find it [here](https://github.com/saagarjha/OpenAdblock).
